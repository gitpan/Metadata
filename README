Metadata - classes for simple metadata
======================================

Copyright (C) 1997-2001 Dave Beckett.  All rights reserved.

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the same terms as Perl itself.

WARNING: THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE.  IT HAS BEEN TESTED AND USED BUT
MAY STILL BE UNRELIABLE.
Beta also means that the interface is unlikely to change.

This collection of modules provide an implementation of Dublin Core
compatible metadata and subclasses for IAFA Templates, SOIF (Harvest)
and should be easily extendible to similar (fairly flat) metadata
formats.

BEFORE BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

    Build, test and install Perl 5 (at least version 5.004).


BUILDING

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install (if the tests look okay)


EXTRAS

lib/Metadata/HTTP wraps an HTTP log line (in common / extended log
format) which may be useful.

The examples directory contains some programs that may be interesting:
  gather
    A sort-of replacement for the Harvest gather program using these
    modules.

  htdig-dump
    dumps an ht://dig search docs database into a Harvest-compatible
    SOIF format (untested).  It should be trivial to convert this
    into a real harvest gatherd.

  scan-log
    HTTP log scanning example attempting to identify robot requests
