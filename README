Metadata - classes for simple metadata
======================================

Copyright (C) 1997-1998 Dave Beckett.  All rights reserved.

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the same terms as Perl itself.

WARNING: THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE.  IT HAS BEEN TESTED AND USED BUT
MAY STILL BE UNRELIABLE.
Beta also means that the interface is unlikely to change.

This collection of modules provide an implementation of Dublin Core
compatible metadata and subclasses for IAFA Templates, SOIF (Harvest)
and should be easily extendible to similar (fairly flat) metadata
formats.
