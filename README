Metadata - classes for simple metadata
======================================

Copyright (C) 1997-1998 Dave Beckett.  All rights reserved.

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify

WARNING: THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE.  IT HAS BEEN TESTED AND USED BUT
MAY STILL BE UNRELIABLE.
Beta also means that the interface is unlikely to change.

This collection of modules provide an implementation of Dublin Core
compatible metadata and subclasses for IAFA Templates, SOIF (Harvest)
and should be easily extendible to similar (fairly flat) metadata
formats.

BEFORE BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

    Build, test and install Perl 5 (at least version 5.004).


BUILDING

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install (if the tests look okay)


EXTRAS

I have created a Metadata::HTTP class that wraps an HTTP log line (in
common / extended log format) which may be useful.  Should it be in
the core since the class is so trivial?  

htdig-dump dumps an ht://dig search docs database into a
Harvest-compatible SOIF format (untested).  It should be trivial to
convert this into a real harvest gatherd.
